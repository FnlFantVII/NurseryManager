            My name is Allison Noa and I have a passion for Heirloom Tomatoes! I have been growing
                them for more than 10 years now. In fact I started by growing them in the window of my
                dorm room in college! Now I'm a blessed momma of three amazing kids who love to play in
                the garden with me. I started this business by growing plants from seed for my own garden
                and then for a few friends. Every year the business grows and now I sell plants to friends, friends
                of friends, and people who I fully expect to call friends by the end of this growing season!
                We are one big happy tomato family!
